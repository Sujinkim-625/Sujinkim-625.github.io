~~download latest administrative divisions SHP file~~
> 🤖 ChatGPT: ~ is mostly correct but could be slightly improved for clarity. The SHP file format is used for storing geospatial data and is commonly associated with GIS (Geographic Information System) applications.

**_Download the latest SHP file of administrative divisions._**
