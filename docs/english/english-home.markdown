> ðŸ¤” Can I use litalic and bold together in markdown?   
ðŸ¤– ChatGPT: You can use both italic and bold formatting together in Markdown. To do this, you combine the syntax for both, which involves using double asterisks (**) for bold and single asterisks (*) or underscores (_) for italic. Here's how you can apply both to a sentence:
{: .fs-3 }

```markdown
**_This sentence will be both bold and italic._**
__*This sentence will also be both bold and italic.*__
```
{: .fs-3 }
